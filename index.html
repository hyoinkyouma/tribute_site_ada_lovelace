            Most wealthy women of the 1800s did not study math and science. Ada
            Lovelace excelled at them.
          </h2>
          <p class="description-text hidden">
            When she was 17, Ada met mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage
            at a town party. She was fascinated by his Difference Engine, an
            early version of the calculator. <br /><br />
            He soon became her mentor. Lovelace imagined that the engine could
            also follow <br />
            patterns—or codes—not only to calculate numbers, but to form
            letters, too. <br />This is a very basic explanation of computer
            programming. <br />
            <br />
            Babbage never received enough funding to complete the Analytical
            Engine. <br />
            Lovelace’s notes were forgotten. <br />
            <br />
            But in 1953, her notes were republished in a book about digital
            computing that showed how computers work by following patterns. It
            turns out that long before the first computer was invented Lovelace
            had come up with the idea for a computer language.

            Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In
            note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to
            compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first
            published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on
            a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first
            computer programmer for this reason.<br /><br />
            The engine was never completed so her program was never tested. In
            1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on
            Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B. V.
            Bowden's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing
            Machines. The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a
            computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.
